# VoiceGuard-AI
VoiceGuard AI A deep learning-powered tool for detecting synthetic speech using a CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model. It analyzes voice samples for deepfake indicators, providing a confidence score for detection
Voice Fidelity Guard is a security-oriented web application that verifies the identity of users through voice authentication. By analyzing voice patterns, this project determines whether the speaker is a genuine registered user or an imposter. This system leverages machine learning and deep learning to ensure robust voice recognition for secure access.

## Overview
With the increase in security threats and identity theft, Voice Fidelity Guard introduces a new layer of protection using **voice biometrics**. It captures a user's voice sample and analyzes it using an AI model to verify authenticity.

### Key Features:
-  **Voice Recording Interface** â€” Record your voice directly from the browser.
-  **AI-Based Voice Analysis** â€” Uses deep learning models to analyze audio features like pitch, frequency, and tone.
- **Authentication Feedback** â€” Indicates whether the voice is authentic or not.
-  **Detailed Analysis Notebook** â€” Jupyter Notebook (`Voice.ipynb`) includes model training, preprocessing, and evaluation.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running `.ipynb` file)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-fidelity-guard.git
   cd voice-fidelity-guard
   

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   
   cd client
   npm install
   

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   
   cd ../server
   npm install
  

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook (optional)**
   Open `Voice.ipynb` to view or retrain the model:
   
   jupyter notebook

   ##  Use Cases

- Secure Login Authentication
- Voice Biometric Verification
- Fraud Detection in Call Centers

##  Model Summary

The notebook (`Voice.ipynb`) implements and compares multiple deep learning models for detecting fake vs real voices:

-  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** â€” Captures long-term voice dependencies.
-  **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** â€” Learns spatial features from spectrograms.
-  **ResNet (Residual Network)** â€” Extracts deep hierarchical features.
-  **CNN-BiLSTM** â€” Combines spatial and temporal modeling for enhanced accuracy.

Each model was evaluated and compared based on accuracy and performance to determine the best-suited architecture for robust voice authentication.
